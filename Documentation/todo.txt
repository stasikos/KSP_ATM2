Autopilot: fuel usage/range calculation
Autopilot: Waypoint navigation and proper distance using "round Gael" system.
Autopilot: Version for airships

Idea: command vehicle to program drones/unmanned vehicles using messages. Also
to perform calculations about range and fuel requirements for airplanes
Actually, it can be ship :)
