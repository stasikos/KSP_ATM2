Proposition:

Vessel name format:

[CODE] [NAME] [VERSION]

CODE may be extended to more letters to include subtypes later
CODE is [TYPE]-[Size]
Where 1-s letter for CODE is:
P for airplanes
H for helicopters
G for ground vehicles
R for rockets
S for stuff flying in space
M for marine vessels
B for static bases
T for static test rigs

Size is muliple-symbol code like "S037" "S125" "S375" to indicate diameter of stack 
used primarilly in design using first 3 digits with no dots. For vessel/craft with 
no  known stack it must be specified as "GENERIC". More specific shapes like "Mk3" 
are written in uppercase like "MK3".

NAME is generic name like "Sparrow" or what else you like.

VERSION is complex:
[Modification]-[Generation]{_P[Payload]}
Modification is significant change in equipment or features, which doesnt make
previous versions obsolete. Generation is simply version of same modification
which makes previous generation obsolete. First prototype version is always 0.

Loadout and payload information may
include something we don't know yet, so it is WIP.

So, Mk2 spaceplane during first trials will be named like this:
P-MK2 Spaceplane A-0.

Mk3 research plane, modification 3, version 5:
P-MK3 Explorer C-3

2.5m rocket, 2-nd modification, version 1:
R-S250 Regress B-1
