This needs some conventions.

Mission name:
[DATE][ORIGIN][NUMBER] - [Short description]


where 
DATE is ingame date like "Y001D001" when mission design started.
ORIGIN is 2-letter code for starting place (first launch, undock, etc).
Gael is GA. 
NUMBER is number of mission, incrementing from 0001, for each new mission, not
depending on date or origin.

So, our first mission is 
Y001D001GA0001 - GSC experiments

Congratulations!
