Outcome: Success

Issues:

Generator was not started;
When driving too fast vehicle is unstable and can flip. Limit your speed to 15
m/s, and <10m/s when turn.
Recovery was not planned properly; Bobert had to convince mission control it was
intended, but they stated: if it is not there, it is not planned.
Bobert had to return on his own.
