- for aircraft in general
	- if aircraft has wheeled landing gear, brake must be configured to not
	  cause instability while stopping even in emergency (brakes balance)
	- landing gear must be properly centered to allow takeoff and not let
	  aircraft crash when flaring
	- if aircraft is made to land and takeoff from runway, it must be able
	  to safely taxi on runway on all speeds below takeoff speed. 
	- aircraft must be supplied with at least minimal communication
	  equipment
	- check center of mass/center of lift balance
	- check stability derivatives for 0.2 mach and 0.6 mach at FAR
	- check for transsonic design if vessel if supersonic

- for crewed aircraft
	- must be able to safely land, either horizontally, or vertically
	- pilot and passengers must be able to leave airplane and return safely,
	  without additional equipment.
	- must have enough comfort and snacks for crew and passangers to sustain
	  entire flight

- for unmanned aircraft
	- it is not necessary to be able to land, but it is desirable.
	- aircraft must have enough electric charge to maintain remote or
	  computer control in any situation


- night operation
	- aircraft must have navigation lights
	- if aircraft is supposed to takeoff and land on ground, landing light
	  is required
